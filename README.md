LiqU-Net: A Liquid Neural Network-Enhanced U-Net for Efficient Copy-Move Forgery Detection and Localization
This repository contains the implementation of the proposed LiqU-Net, a ResNet50 + Liquid Neural Network (LNN) enhanced U-Net model for copy-move forgery detection and localization.
The model integrates:
----ResNet50 as a backbone for feature extraction,
----LNN (Liquid Neural Network) layers for dynamic and adaptive learning,
----U-Net style decoder for precise pixel-level localization.
